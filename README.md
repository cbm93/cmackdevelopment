# Customization and Editing

In general, most styles on the page are based off the definitions of variables in the variable section of the style sheet:

// Define background and font colors
background: #fff;
font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
font-weight: 300;

// Define text 
color: #fff;
text-align: center;



# Images

The template comes with a number of images, logos I have created for the purpose of this template which act simply as placeholders and should be switched.
